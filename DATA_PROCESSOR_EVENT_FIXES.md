# Data Processor Event Interface Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### Problem
The `DataProcessorService` was importing event interfaces from the wrong location and there were duplicate/conflicting event interface definitions.

### Root Cause
Event interfaces were defined in two places:
1. `interfaces/processor-config.interface.ts` (incorrect location)
2. `events/processor.events.ts` (correct location)

The service was importing from the first location, but the actual event definitions that should be used were in the second file.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Fixed Import Statements
**Before:**
```typescript
import {
  ProcessorConfig,
  ScraperItemFoundEvent,
  DataProcessorBatchEvent,
  DataProcessorErrorEvent,
  DataProcessorStatsEvent,
} from '../interfaces/processor-config.interface'
import { SCRAPER_EVENTS, DATA_PROCESSOR_EVENTS } from '../events/processor.events'
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { ProcessorConfig } from '../interfaces/processor-config.interface'
import {
  ScraperItemFoundEvent,
  DataProcessorBatchEvent,
  DataProcessorErrorEvent,
  DataProcessorStatsEvent,
  SCRAPER_EVENTS,
  DATA_PROCESSOR_EVENTS,
} from '../events/processor.events'
```

#### 2. Cleaned Up Duplicate Event Interfaces
Removed duplicate event interfaces from `processor-config.interface.ts`:
- `ProcessorEvent`
- `ItemFoundEvent` 
- `BatchProcessedEvent`
- `TransformationErrorEvent`

These were conflicting with the correct definitions in `processor.events.ts`.

#### 3. Kept Only Configuration Interfaces
The `processor-config.interface.ts` file now only contains:
- `ProcessorConfig`
- `DeduplicationConfig`
- `TransformationConfig`

## ✅ Correct Event Interfaces Now Used

The service now correctly uses these event interfaces from `events/processor.events.ts`:

```typescript
export interface ScraperItemFoundEvent {
  jobId: string
  provider: string
  item: any
  sourceUrl?: string
  metadata?: Record<string, any>
  timestamp: Date
}

export interface DataProcessorBatchEvent {
  jobId: string
  provider: string
  batchSize: number
  duplicatesSkipped: number
  itemsStored: number
  errors: number
  timestamp: Date
}

export interface DataProcessorErrorEvent {
  jobId: string
  provider: string
  item?: any
  error: string
  stage: 'deduplication' | 'transformation' | 'storage'
  timestamp: Date
}

export interface DataProcessorStatsEvent {
  jobId: string
  provider: string
  totalProcessed: number
  totalDuplicates: number
  totalStored: number
  totalErrors: number
  timestamp: Date
}
```

## ✅ Event Constants Available

```typescript
export const SCRAPER_EVENTS = {
  ITEM_FOUND: 'scraper.itemFound',
} as const

export const DATA_PROCESSOR_EVENTS = {
  BATCH_PROCESSED: 'dataProcessor.batchProcessed',
  ITEM_STORED: 'dataProcessor.itemStored',
  DUPLICATE_SKIPPED: 'dataProcessor.duplicateSkipped',
  TRANSFORMATION_ERROR: 'dataProcessor.transformationError',
  PROCESSING_ERROR: 'dataProcessor.processingError',
  STATS_UPDATED: 'dataProcessor.statsUpdated',
} as const
```

## ✅ Files Modified

1. **`data-processor.service.ts`**
   - Fixed import statements to use correct event interfaces
   - All event handling now uses proper interfaces

2. **`processor-config.interface.ts`**
   - Removed duplicate event interface definitions
   - Now only contains configuration interfaces

## ✅ Impact

- **Event Emission**: All events now use correct, consistent interface definitions
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types for all event handlers
- **No Conflicts**: Single source of truth for event interfaces
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between config and event interfaces

The data processor service now correctly handles all events with proper typing and will work seamlessly with the GraphQL subscriptions and real-time frontend updates.
